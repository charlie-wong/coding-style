Background
===============================================================================
As every C++ programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, but this power brings with
it complexity, which in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.

The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in detail the dos and don'ts of
writing C++ code. These rules exist to keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders
to use C++ language features productively. And if you following the `C part <../c/index.html>`_ of
CodingArt, then all will be consistent when you have to use C in C++, and no collision.

Style, also known as readability, is what called the conventions that govern the C++ code.
The term ``style`` is a bit of a misnomer, since these conventions cover far more than just source
file formatting.

Features
===============================================================================

Compilers support various extensions that are not part of the standard C.
Nonstandard extensions should not be used unless necessary, for example: the
GCC's ``__attribute__``, designated initializers, e.g. ``foo_st f = {.field = 3}``

Pros
    - Important performance guidance to the compiler can only
      be specified using extensions.
    - Nonstandard extensions may provide useful features that
      do not exist in the standard C. For example, the designated
      initializers are more readable.

Cons
    - Nonstandard extensions do not work in all compilers,
      reduces portability of code.
    - Even if they are supported in all targeted compilers,
      the extensions are often not well-specified, and there
      may be subtle behavior differences between compilers.

Decision
    Do not use nonstandard extensions directly & bare, use portability
    wrappers with them, so long as those wrappers are provided all things
    will work fine.

.. tip::
    - Variable-length-arrays can cause hard to detect stack overflows, not use unless necessary.

.. _c_feature_data_struct:

Data Struct
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When declaring variables in structures, declare them organized in a manner to
attempt to minimize the memory wastage because of compiler alignment issues.

- Each member variable gets its own type and line.
- Note that the use of bitfields in general is discouraged.

Major structures should be declared at the top of file in which they are used,
or in separate headers, if they are used in multiple source files. The declaration
and the usage should be separated if they are used more then once.

.. _c_feature_usage_of_const:

Usage of Const
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use ``const`` whenever it makes sense.

- Easier for people to understand how variables are being used.
- Allows the compiler to do better type checking, and generate better code.
- Helps correctness the program by telling how they can modify the variables.

Use ``const`` pointer whenever it makes sense..

Some people favor the form ``int const *ptr`` to ``const int *ptr``.

They argue that this is more readable because it's more consistent:
it keeps the rule that ``const`` always follows the object it's describing.
However, this consistency argument doesn't apply in codebases with few
deeply-nested pointer expressions since most const expressions have only one
``const``. In such cases, there's no consistency to maintain. Putting the
``const`` first is arguably more readable, since it follows English in putting
the **adjective** (``const``) before the **noun** (``int``).

.. _c_feature_integer_types:

Integer Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The built-in integer types:

``char``, ``int``, ``uint8_t``, ``int8_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``int16_t``,
``uint32_t``, ``int32_t``, ``uint64_t``, ``int64_t``, ``uintmax_t``,
``intmax_t``, ``size_t``, ``ssize_t``, ``uintptr_t``, ``intptr_t``, ``ptrdiff_t``

Use ``int`` for error codes, local and trivial variables only. BE(Big Endian)
care when converting integer types. Integer conversions and promotions can
cause non-intuitive behavior. Note that the signedness of ``char`` is
implementation defined.

There are no convenient ``printf`` format placeholders for fixed width types.
Cast to ``uintmax_t`` or ``intmax_t`` if have to format fixed width integers.

+---------------+-----------+--------+
| Type          | unsigned  | signed |
+===============+===========+========+
| char          | %hhu      | %hhd   |
+---------------+-----------+--------+
| int           | n/a       | %d     |
+---------------+-----------+--------+
| (u)intmax_t   | %ju       | %jd    |
+---------------+-----------+--------+
| (s)size_t     | %zu       | %zd    |
+---------------+-----------+--------+
| ptrdiff_t     | %tu       | %td    |
+---------------+-----------+--------+

.. tip::

    - If needs different size of integers, use a precise-width integer
      type from ``<stdint.h>``.
    - If a variable represents a value that could ever be greater than or
      equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type, such as ``int64_t``.
    - Keep in mind that even if your value won't ever be too large for an int,
      it may be used in intermediate calculations which may require a larger type.

.. _c_feature_usage_of_bool:

Usage of Bool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use bool type to represent bool values when it is possible.

.. code-block:: c

    int  is_good = 1; // Bad - should have type bool.
    bool is_good = true; // Good - just use boolean type where possible.

.. _c_feature_variable_declarations:

Variable Declarations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declare only one variable per line, and each line have only one sentence.

.. code-block:: c

    int i, j = 1; // this is not recommended
    int k=0; func(); // never do this also

    int i = 0; // this will more clear
    int j = 1; // no bug easy to hide
    int k = 0;
    func();

.. _c_feature_NULL_NUL_zero:

NULL & NUL and Zero
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Use ``0.0`` for real
- Use ``0`` for integer
- Use ``NULL`` for pointer
- Use ``'\0'`` or ``NUL`` for char

.. _c_feature_usage_of_sizeof:

Usage of sizeof
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prefer ``sizeof(varname)`` to ``sizeof(type)``.

Use ``sizeof(varname)`` when you take the size of a particular variable.
``sizeof(varname)`` will update appropriately if someone changes the variable
type either now or later.

You may use ``sizeof(type)`` for the code unrelated to any particular variable.

.. _c_feature_usage_of_goto:

Usage of goto
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just do not use ``goto`` when it is absolutely necessary.

The ``goto`` statement comes in handy when a function exits from multiple
locations and some common work such as cleanup has to be done. If there is
no cleanup needed then just return directly.

The abusively use of ``goto`` make code hard to read and management, so just
use it as rare as possible. If for some reason, you must use ``goto``, then
choose label names which say what the ``goto`` does or why the ``goto`` exists.

The rationale for using ``gotos`` is:

- nesting is reduced.
- saves the compiler work to optimize redundant code away.
- errors by not updating individual exit points when making modifications are prevented.

A common type of bug to be aware of is **one err** bug which look like this:

.. code-block:: c

    err:
        kfree(foo->bar);
        kfree(foo);
        return ret;

The bug in this code is that on some exit paths ``foo`` is ``NULL``.
Normally the fix for this bug is to split it up into two error labels
``err_free_bar`` and ``err_free_foo``, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    err_free_bar:
        kfree(foo->bar);
    err_free_foo:
        kfree(foo);
        return ret;

.. _c_feature_usage_of_macros:

Usage of Macros
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
``do { ... } while(0)``, so that a trailing semicolon works, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    // Align of \ may make it hard to modify it later, so
    // just do not do it, the following is enough better
    #define macrofun(a, b, c) \
        do \
        { \
            if(a == 5) \
            { \
                do_this(b, c); \
            } \
        } while(0)

    // This is also good if it clear enough for one line
    #define macrofun(a, b, c)   do { if(a == 5) do_this(b, c); } while(0)

Avoid using macros if they affect control flow, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    // do not recommended do it like this
    #define FOO(x)  do { if(blah(x) < 0) return ERROR_CODE; } while(0)

Avoid using macros if they depend on having a local variable with a magic name, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    // what the hell of the 'index' and 'val'
    #define FOO(val)    bar(index, val)

Make the expression precedence very very clear by using properly
parentheses. It should be used with caution because of the potential
for error when invoked with an expression that has side effects. When
putting expressions into macros always wrap the expression in parenthesis
to avoid potential communitive operation abiguity.

.. code-block:: c

    #define MIN(x, y)  ((x<y)?(x):(y))  // OK uppercase
    #define max(x, y)  ((x>y)?(x):(y))  // OK like function
    ...
    max(f(x), z++); // as less as possible

.. _c_feature_conditional_compilation:

Conditional Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever possible, donâ€™t use preprocessor conditionals ``#if``, ``#ifdef`` and
likes in ``.c`` files, and doing so makes code harder to read and logic harder
to follow. Instead, use such conditionals in a header file defining functions
for use in those ``.c`` files, providing no-operation stub in the ``#else``
case, and then call those functions unconditionally from ``.c`` files. The
compiler will avoid generating any code for the stub calls, producing identical
results, but the logic will remain easy to follow.

If you have a function or variable which may potentially go unused in a particular
configuration, and the compiler would warn about its definition going unused,
so just mark the definition with ``__attribute__((unused))``
(see `See GCC Attribute Syntax <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Attribute-Syntax.html>`_)
rather than wrapping it in a preprocessor conditional. However, if a function
or variable always goes unused, why not just delete it.

At the end of any non-trivial ``#if`` or ``#ifdef`` block, which acros more than
a few lines or mutil-levels, place a comment after the it on the same line,
noting the conditional usage. For instance:

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef CONFIG_SOMETHING

    doing_some_thing

    #endif // CONFIG_SOMETHING

Do NOT put ``#ifdef`` likes in an expressions for readability, which is
error prone and make it harder to following the code, for example:

.. code-block:: c

    // Why not make it clear
    int ret = func_a()
    #ifdef HAS_XXX
        + func_b()
    #endif
        + func_c() *
    #if IS_TRUE
          mutil_this
    #else
          mutil_that
    #endif
        - a_value;

.. _c_mixing_c_and_cpp:

Mixing C and C++
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When calling a C function from C++, the function name will be mangled unless
you turn it off. Name mangling is turned off with the ``extern "C"`` syntax.

- To create a C function in C++, must wrap it with the ``extern "C"``.
- To call a C function from C++, must wrap in with the ``extern "C"``.

.. code-block:: c

    // Creating a C function in C++
    extern "C"
    void a_c_function_in_cplusplus(int a)
    {
        do_some_thing();
    }

    // This maybe more better
    #define CFUNC   extern "C"
    CFUNC void a_c_function_in_cplusplus(int a)
    {
        do_some_thing();
    }

    // Calling C function from C++
    extern "C" int strncpy(...);
    extern "C" int my_great_function();
    extern "C"
    {
        int strncpy(...);
        int my_great_function();
    };

If you have code that must compile in C and C++ environment, then
you should use the ``__cplusplus`` preprocessor directive to wrap them, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef __cplusplus
        extern "C" some_function();
    #else
        extern some_function();
    #endif
